    "Tutorials should only really be started once the channel is more popular and people have gotten to know the roster. In these videos, one person will explain how to do something in production, or explain a concept. These will be more serious and focused than the challenge videos, but still entertaining. Each member of the channel should only do tutorials on things they are especially good at. This ensures the most helpful information and also shows the audience what each member is good at.",
    "Breakdowns\nThis one is pretty straightforward. The members of the roster will make a video breaking down a song they’ve made that they believe has lots of cool tricks or helpful bits. I would say this should not be done very commonly since it takes away from the group focus of the channel.",
    "Advice\nWe can think of a catchier title for this series, like “Ask The Hub” or something. Each video will feature several members of the roster giving their take on a topic. The topics in these videos will be less about how to make music and more about subjective things like organization, staying motivated, and marketing. Each person featured in the video should really develop their opinion as much as possible and present it in an engaging way. The videos could feature multiple similar questions, or just one specific thing. Eventually we can start taking questions from viewers in the videos as well.",
    "Other Details\nWe will need to find someone to edit the videos for the Hub channel. That could be one person or multiple people, paid or not. The most important part is that every video has a similar appearance in terms of structure, visuals, and style. Every video should also have some form of post commentary/narration.",
    "Producer Hub YT Channel\nOverview\nMusic production channel with a group dynamic; videos are candid and lighthearted for the most part, but still informative. The main content on the channel will be:\n- producer challenges (ex. sample flips, no hearing, found sounds only)\n- tutorials (ex. Fixing a muddy mix, making good kicks, making a growl in serum)\n- producer advice (ex. how to stay motivated, how to organize your sample library)\n- other miscellaneous stuff",
    "Roster\nThe channel will have a “roster” of 5-10 people who each appear in most videos. These people will participate in the challenges, record tutorials on topics they are good with, give advice, and participate in the other activities. They don’t need to be in every video but should try to be in as many as they can. They will livestream/record on their own, and their videos/streams will be sent to the channel manager to organize into videos.",
    "Challenges\nOnce a challenge idea is decided on, each member of the roster will either stream or record themselves doing the challenge. They should talk about what they’re doing and what’s going through their mind as they go. The challenges will be around 1-2 hours long and everyone will do it at the same time. The participants can be in a call together or just on their own. Once the time is up, everyone will submit their entry and the judging will happen. This could either be done live or recorded. After the challenge is over, everyone’s recordings will be compiled into a video with extra editing and post commentary to bring everything together.",

    "1:10:459 -- Too much overdrive, not enough sub. Also, using an A#0 and an A0 as the main notes of a bass is not the best idea cause A is right in the middle range of being too high for a sub to be felt, and too low for a sub to be heard. I made a sub track for you if you want to use it. Make sure to mix it *above* the bass and perc.  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/i9kAJ2P.png\nAlso, the snare masks the kick a bit too much. (mostly cause of the tail thats too noisy)",
    "1:28:073 -- I like the hats the come in here",
    "2:12:110 -- I like the idea of this bass rise, but it doesnt work if you dont have a sub to go allong with it. A sub is what atts intensity to a bass, and the entire purpose of this bass is to build intensity. ",
    "2:20:917 -- More sub issues... i dont know if theres even supposed to be a sub here or not. Also the length of the sidechain seems to change. Are you using a compressor for sidechain? Make sure the SC envelope is the same length. For this song i think a length of 206ms works really well, with this curve: https://i.imgur.com/3rVozRa.png\nAnother thing is that when you transition to a new note in the bass, the tail carries over onto the nextnote, which is an issue for more dissonant intervals. (2:29:725)",
    "2:57:147 -- Everything is wawy too quiet here. Maybe bring up the bass thing and change around the synth a bit so it sounds unique. I like the perc tho",
    "3:31:376 -- Dayum, nice. Suffers from the same issue of the other drop(s) but its a lot cleaner. use SUB!! The fills in the section are also really nice.",
    "\nOverall, flows really nicely, buteres issues in the mixing of the perc (snare specifcally) and the nonexistant sub. You can get a better sub by not building it into your patches, especially if those patches have a lot of detune. Another thing i noticed is that you use the same 4 chords through the entire song, which is really that much of an issue, but still gets a bit tiresom after 3 or 4 minutes of it.",
    "<@!683792601219989601> 0:00 -- that reverbed out clap doesnt have a transient, which is needs if you want there to be an impact at the start (attention grabber)",
    "0:00 - 0:17:615 -- Sidechain is a bitt too violent, and the gain of the peaks after the sidechain isnt consistant, even with the contour of the frequency of the note. ",
    "0:17:615 -- when those tiako drum rim shot clap  (or whatever they are) come in, they sound like the mids are boosted way too much, or some sort of reverb difusion fuckery is going on. Put a bell eq on those drums subtracting 4dB at 1khz and another at 4.54khz subtracting 5dB, or something around that range. https://i.imgur.com/EDm698O.png\nAlso, the anvil sound you have is super cool and could be brought out more",
    "0:35:229 -- Right, so when these drums come in the kick doesnt hit hard enough (lacks low end) and the snare hits WAY too hard, because of how noisy and compressed the tail is. Maybe put a fade on the end of the snare (amp env) that shortens it a bit. Also you have the same same issue here with the frequencies from 1 - 5k being way too loud and masking the bass and arp.",
    "0:43:486 -- this element that sounds like an overcompressed reverb tail (which, dont get me wrong, can be used well is a lot of cases) is too intrusive here. I do like how it flows though, so maybe try using a sustained element that isnt so noisy.  ",

    "0:52:844 - 1:10:459 -- gets too loud too quickly. This entire intro section suffers from  too much noise in the 1 - 5k reigon, which masks all the melodic elements and takes away from he build. MEGA SAUSAGE https://i.imgur.com/EDm698O.png",

    "yeah",
    "it would sound exactly the same and be easier to mix",
    "k",
    "so i can use supersaws?",
    "if I offset the phases of the bins so that on an oscilloscope the wave no longer resembles a saw but still contains the same harmonics would that count as a saw?",
    "and if i chain together multiple saws fming eachother i can literally just make seeded noise.... does that still count as a saw wave?",
    "and what about FM? am i allowed to fm a saw wave to another saw wave, or can I only use lfos under 20hz to modulate pitch/amplitude?",

    "can i use phase cancelation in two saw waves to make a square wave",

    "it's just some dudes in a vc chilling",
    "oh yeah",
    "it's also assuming people will join vc in the first place lol",
    "oh yeah that's a fantastic idea actually",
    "but yeah",
    "cause theres no discord compression and audio degradation",
    "well recording the screen with OBS would be a lot better imo",
    "oh?",
    "yeah, something along those lines",
    "even if we don't upload anything it could be cool",
    "for this challenge i'd like to see if we can try something like that",
    "but yeah",
    "AUTOCORRECT WHAT",
    "and ofc andrew guangzhou does an amazing job",
    "i really like the pace of ben jordan's videos",
    "not really. there's been a lot more fast paced stuff lately with the onset of tiktok",
    "cause honesty most people watching are gonna care about that sort of stuff",
    "i think that having the video a bit longer is worth it for the extra info and the more laid back feel",
    "well i think that cutting stuff like that just for the sake of making the video fast paced is kinda stupid",
    "lol ig it's just good to be careful with that sort of thing",
    "yeah ofc",
    "that gets iffey with copyrights",
    "<@683792601219989601> ^^ what do you think of these ideas?",
    "yeah stuff like that",
    "well yeah the challenge names would have to be eye catching in titles and thumbnails to get those coveted clicks",
    "i feel like if there was one video that compared how people got creative with the challenge it would be a bit lee cohesive",
    "those videos usually don't have like a resulting conslusion, just a bunch of miscellaneous tidbits of information, that may be useful, but unrelated",
    "that's a good idea, but where would the content be",
    "oh yeah that makes sense",
    "i would actually really like to know others' opinions about this server having a youtube channel",
    "ok",

    "hm",
    "so like for tiktok",
    "i feel like 5 - 10 minute tutorials are the best length for youtube",
    "ok",
    "there's some good editors in here, like lightspark. i can also use premier pro",
    "what if this server created a youtube channel that featured all of us, and we would have regularly uploaded music tutorials onto that channel",
